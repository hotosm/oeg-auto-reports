# OEG Auto reports

This repository stores [Tasking Manager](https://github.com/hotosm/tasking-manager) project data automatically reported by [OEG Reporter](https://github.com/hotosm/oeg-reporter) according to the suggestions made by the [Organized Editing Guidelines](https://wiki.osmfoundation.org/wiki/Organised_Editing_Guidelines).

This data is also reported to a [MediaWiki instance](http://oeg-reporter.hotosm.org/index.php/Main_Page), in the future we plan to report this data to the [OpenStreetMap wiki](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Main_Page) after validating the edits made automatically by the OEG Reporter with the OpenStreetMap Data Working Group.

For more details on how this data is reported, visit the [OEG Reporter repository](https://github.com/hotosm/oeg-reporter). Below is a simplified version of the architecture used for this.
